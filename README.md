Thanks for taking a look at my repo.

This is a rebuild of a project I did while at Hack Reactor.

It is my attempt at creating a microservice copy of the AirBnB reservation calendar.

This repo leverages React, Node, Express, and MySQL.

One can run it on their local machine using the following terminal commands with npm packet manager:

npm install
npm seeddb
npm run build
npm start

You can also view this microservice deployed with seed data on my portfolio site at:
